HW 4 problem 6

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises   

    And: use AndE1 and AndE2
    Implies, left side implies, use ImplyE
3. Look at the top level operator, that is guide for next 

& top level then? Think of two sides as two seperate proofs, 
try to contruct individually and try to put togeter with AndI.

| top level then? look at the two sides, can you prove one of them 
by themselves? If so, do that and use OrI1 or OrI2. See if you have 
and OR statement already if you do try OrE to build your conclusion. 

__>: - use ImplyI subproof. Assume left side of our goal and try to reach the right
side.

!(something) - use NegI subproof. Assume "something", try to get a F (contradiction)

just a propostional atom? like p. 
    see where the atom appears in previous cleams 
    is it on the right side of an ->? 
        try to prove the left side of -> to use ImplyE.
    Do you have an OR statement as a claim? Try OrE 
    to get your atom in both cases. 
    Can we get F? use BottomE to conclude our atom. 
    Try PbC subproof. Asume !p, try to get F. 

After Each claim - ? ? 
    scan all of the possible info, including assumes as see if 
    anything can be extracted such as (AND, IMPLIES)

Inside of a subproof -
 What are the different ones?
    OrE - bothsubproof needs to End with the same claim
    (which should be what I was trying to prove when I opened 
    OrE) 
    ImplyI - try to get the right side of my goal ImplyI 
    PbC - F
    NegI - F

    after opening a subproof and writing down a goal, 
    find the top level operator of that goal. Follow the same 
    pattern to nest a subproof and build that goal. 

    when do we open a subproof? 
        when you have one of the 4 statements above in mind. 
    
    can we assume anything in a subproof? 
        can assume ANY one statement when opening a subproof; but
        it must follow one of the 4 above patterns. PATTERN IN MIND. 

    Doesn't fit a pattern or work out from above?
        Might hit a wall, and this will mean that a different strategy needs
        to be taken on. 
            Do you have an OR as a claim? 
                try OrE with it. 
            nothing is working? try PbC. Assume !(whatever is being proven)
            try to get a F contradiction. 
        
    When to use BottomE? 
        IF WE are using OrE and can't get the goal in one 
        subproof but I can get a contradiction (F).

        Don't use in PbC or NegI if you get F, even though it is possible, 
        as it won't help finish the proof.  



p → q   equivalent to   ¬p ∨ q

WHEN PROVING EQUIVALENT - 2 PROOFS


p → q  ⊢  ¬p ∨ q ** 
    Top-level op of the concl is an OR 
    Can I prove one of the sides? 
    As a backup, try PbC. 
        Assume !(!p | q)
            If we had !p | q, we would have a F. 
                Try to prove just !p so can use OrI1 
                Use NegI subproof 
                    Assume p 


        Goal: F
        conclude !p 
        to build OR statement and become the contradiction. 

     



¬p ∨ q   ⊢  p → q
look at conclusion: top level- is __>: 
ImplyI subproof
    Assume p

    Goal: q




/////////////////////////

HW 4 problem 7

¬(p → q)    equivalent to   p ∧ ¬q


¬(p → q)  ⊢  p ∧ ¬q
Think about proving both sides seperately p doesn't work
As a last resort try PbC on the conclusion

    Assume ¬(p → q) 
        If we had p __>: q, would contradict with premise
        Try ImplyI subproof to get p __>: q 

        Assume p 
            No obvious way to get q, try PbC.
            Subproof, assume !q. 

            Goal: F 

        goal: q
    Goal: F



p ∧ ¬q   ⊢   ¬(p → q)
Break apart the premise 
Use NegI subproof for the conclusion 
    Assume (p → q)
     
    goal F



/////////////////////////

How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises 
        AND statement?
        IMPLIES statement?


3. Look at what you are trying to prove 
    (what do we look for in goal/conclusion?)

    ∧ - 

    ∨ -   

    → - 

    ¬(something) - 

    just a propositional atom? like p.


After each claim - 



Inside a subproof - 
    (What are the different subproofs?)

    --> when do we open a subproof?

    --> can we assume anything in a subproof? 




Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above?



When to use BottomE?




//////////////////////////////////

Bigger example: big.sc

//////////////////////////////////

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle. (LEM)

p ∨ ¬p



What would a theorem be in a truth table?
tautology



Prove LEM (lem.sc): LAW OF THE EXCLUDED MIDDLE

⊢ ( p ∨ ¬p )               //lem.sc



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of natural deduction in
    propositional logic

    "provable": prove using natural deduction
    "true": demonstrate an argument with truth tables


SOUNDNESS: ?? everything I can prove is actually true.


p ∧ q 
--------
p


COMPLETENESS: ?? I can prove everything that is true. 

propositional logic deduction is both sound and complete 





--> what would it mean if a proof system was unsound?



--> what would it mean if a proof system was incomplete?






Propositional logic is both SOUND and COMPLETE.



Using natural deduction to prove the sequent:
    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


Is equivalent to using truth tables to show that whenever
    P1, P2, ..., Pn
are true, then q is also true

(in-class quiz)

//////////////////////////////////////

Sets.

A set is an unordered collection of elements


{1,1,3,5,7} = {1,3,5,7} = {7,3,1,5}



∈: is in, exists in

    x ∈ A  means? element x exists in the set A 

    x ∉ A  means? element x does not exist in set A 



Example: A = {1,4,7,11,20}

    1 ∈ A : 1 exists in A
    2 ∉ A : 2 does not exist in A 



- Common sets in math:

    ℕ: natural number (integers starting with 1)    
    ℤ: integers (positive, negative, 0)
    ℚ: Rational numbers. I can write the number as p/q 
        where p, q ∈ Z and q != 0
    ℝ: real numbers 
    ℂ: complex numbers 
    ∅: null set / empty set 

ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ

⊂ is subset of 

////////////////////////////////////

Set builder notation.

: means, where, such that
| means the same thing

{variable : conditions}


{x: x ∈ ℕ, 5 ≤ x ≤ 10}
The set of all X such that X is a natural number between 5 and 10
{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}


{k : k is a letter in "abracadabra"}
{a, b, c, d, r}



{x : x = 2k,  k ∈ ℕ}

{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}



{n : n = k^2, k ∈ Z}



{n : n = 3a + 1, a ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ a ≤ 4}



//////////////////////////////////////



Describe these sets in set builder notation


{5,10,15}



{CIS 115, CIS 200, CIS 300, CIS 301}



{2,4,8,16,32}

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

Set union, ⋃

The union of the sets A and B, written A ⋃ B, is the set
of all elements....?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋃ B =


//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

Set intersection, ⋂

The intersection of the sets A and B, written A ⋂ B, is the set
of all elements that are...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋂ B =

///////////////////////////////////////

Set difference,

/ or \ (means the same thing)

The difference between the sets A and B, written A - B, is the set
of all elements...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A - B =

//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

A = {1,3,7,10,11,12}

B = {2,3,4,5,6,7}


Find:

A ⋃ B =

A ⋂ B =

A - B =

B - A =


//////////////////

Subset - A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if
    all elements in A are also in B.

(We say A ⊂ B if A is a subset of B but A ≠ B.)




Example:

A = {1,3,4}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?



A = {8,1,3}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?
