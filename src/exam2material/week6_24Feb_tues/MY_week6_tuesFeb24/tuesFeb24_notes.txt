HW 4 problem 6

p → q   equivalent to   ¬p ∨ q


p → q  ⊢  ¬p ∨ q

     



¬p ∨ q   ⊢  p → q




/////////////////////////

HW 4 problem 7

¬(p → q)    equivalent to   p ∧ ¬q


¬(p → q)  ⊢  p ∧ ¬q




p ∧ ¬q   ⊢   ¬(p → q)

How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises 
        AND: AndE1 and AndE2
        IMPLIES, left side of the implies: use ImplyE 


3. Look at what you are trying to prove 
    (what do we look for in goal/conclusion?)
    look at top level operator - that'll guide your approach
    ∧ - think of two sides as two separate proofs.
        Try to construct them both individually, put them together with AndI.

    ∨ - look at two sides - can you prove one of them by themselves? 
        If so, do that and use OrI1 or OrI2.

        See if you have an or statement already. If you do, try OrE

    → - Use ImplyI subproof. Assume left side of our goal, try to reach right side

    ¬(something) - use NegI subproof. Assume "something" and try to get F (contradiction)

    just a propositional atom? like p.
        see where the atom appears in previoius claims.
        Is it on the right side of an ->?
            Try to prove the left side of the -> to use ImplyI
        Do you have an or statement as claim? 
            Try OrE to get atom in both cases
        Can we get a F? Use BottomE to conclude atom.
        Try PbC SubProof. Assume ¬p, try to get F


After each claim - scan all available info, including assumes. 
See if you can extract anything (And, Implies)



Inside a subproof - 
    (What are the different subproofs?)
    OrE - both subproofs need to end with the same claim (should be whatever I was trying to prove when I opened subproofs)
    ImplyI - try to get right side of goal imply statement
    PbC - F 
    NegI - F


    after opening a subproof and writing down a goal, 
    find top level operator of that goal. Follow same pattern
     to nest subproof to build that goal.
    
    
    --> when do we open a subproof?
    when you have one of the four subproofs in mind


    --> can we assume anything in a subproof? 
    can assume any one statement when opening a subproof,
    but don't do it unless you have a pattern in mind


Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above?
mind hit a brick wall - need to try a different strtegy
    do you have an OR as a claim? try OrE with it
    nothing's working? Try PbC. Assume the opposite of conclusion.
    Try to get a F contradiction


When to use BottomE?
If you are using OrE and can't get goal in one subproof but can get F, 
use BottomE to conclude what you want.

Don't use in PbC or NegI if you get F, even though it is possible, as it won't help finish the proof.

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle. (LEM)

p ∨ ¬p



What would a theorem be in a truth table?
tautology



Prove LEM (lem.sc):

⊢ ( p ∨ ¬p )               //lem.sc



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of natural deduction in
    propositional logic

    "provable": prove using natural deduction
    "true": demonstrate an argument with truth tables


SOUNDNESS: ?? everything I can prove is actually true

p ∧ q 
--------
p


COMPLETENESS: ?? I can prove everything that is true

propositional logic deduction is both sound and completeness



--> what would it mean if a proof system was unsound?



--> what would it mean if a proof system was incomplete?






Propositional logic is both SOUND and COMPLETE.



Using natural deduction to prove the sequent:
    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


Is equivalent to using truth tables to show that whenever
    P1, P2, ..., Pn
are true, then q is also true

Sets.

A set is an unordered collection of elements


{1,1,3,5,7} = {1,3,5,7} = {7,3,1,5}



∈: is in, exists in

    x ∈ A  means? element x exists in set A

    x ∉ A  means? element x does not exist in set A



Example: A = {1,4,7,11,20}

    1 ∈ A 
    2 ∉ A



- Common sets in math:

    ℕ: Natural numbers (integers starting with 1)
    ℤ: Integers (positive, negative, 0)
    ℚ: Rational Numbers. Write number as p/q, where p, q ∈ ℤ
    ℝ: Real Numbers
    ℂ: Complex numbers
    ∅: null set / empty set

ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ


⊂ is subset of 
////////////////////////////////////

Set builder notation.

: means, where, such that
| means the same thing

{variable : conditions}


{x: x ∈ ℕ, 5 ≤ x ≤ 10}
{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}


{k : k is a letter in "abracadabra"}

{a, b, c, d, r}

{x : x = 2k,  k ∈ ℕ}

{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

{n : n = k^2, k ∈ Z}



{n : n = 3a + 1, a ∈ ℕ, 1 ≤ a ≤ 4}



//////////////////////////////////////



Describe these sets in set builder notation


{5,10,15}



{CIS 115, CIS 200, CIS 300, CIS 301}



{2,4,8,16,32}

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

Set union, ⋃

The union of the sets A and B, written A ⋃ B, is the set
of all elements....?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋃ B =


//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

Set intersection, ⋂

The intersection of the sets A and B, written A ⋂ B, is the set
of all elements that are...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A ⋂ B =

///////////////////////////////////////

Set difference,

/ or \ (means the same thing)

The difference between the sets A and B, written A - B, is the set
of all elements...?


How could we express in set builder notation?

A - B =

//////////////////////////////////////
⋃ ⋂ ⋁ ⋀ ∈ ∉
///////////////////////////////////////

A = {1,3,7,10,11,12}

B = {2,3,4,5,6,7}


Find:

A ⋃ B =

A ⋂ B =

A - B =

B - A =


//////////////////

Subset - A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if
    all elements in A are also in B.

(We say A ⊂ B if A is a subset of B but A ≠ B.)




Example:

A = {1,3,4}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?



A = {8,1,3}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?
