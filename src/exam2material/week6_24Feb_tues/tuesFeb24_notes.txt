How do we approach proofs?

1. Write out all the premises
2. Extract all information from premises 
        (what situations?)

        And : use AndE1 and AndE2
        Implies, left side of the implies: use ImplyE


3. Look at what you are trying to prove 
    (what do we look for in goal/conclusion?)
    look at top level operator - that will guide your approach


    ∧ - think of two sides as two separate proofs.
        Try to construct them both individually, put
        them together with AndI.

    ∨ - look at the two sides - can you prove one of
        them by themselves? If so, do that and use OrI1
        or OrI2. 

        See if you have an OR statement already. If you
        do, try OrE to build your conclusion.

    → - use ImplyI subproof. Assume left side of our goal,
        try to reach right side

    ¬(something) - use NegI subproof. Assume "something",
        try to get F (contradiction)

    just a propositional atom? like p.
        see where the atom appears in previous claims
        Is it on the right side of an ->?
            try to prove the left side of the -> to use ImplyE
        Do you have an OR statement as a claim? Try
            OrE to get your atom in both cases.
        Can we get a F? Use BottomE to conclude our atom.
        Try PbC subproof. Assume ¬p, try to get F.


After each claim - scan all available info (including assumes),
    see if you can extract anything (AND, IMPLIEs)



Inside a subproof - 
    (What are the different subproofs?)

    Goal at end of each:
    OrE - both subproofs need to end with the same
        claim (which should be whatever I was trying
        to prove when I opened the OrE subproofs)
    ImplyI - try to get to the right side of my
        goal imply statement
    PbC - F
    NegI - F

    after opening a subproof and writing down a goal,
    find top level operator of that goal. Follow 
    the same pattern to nest a subproof to build that goal.

    --> when do we open a subproof?
        when you have one of the four subproofs in mind

    --> can we assume anything in a subproof? 

    can assume ANY one statement when opening a subproof

    but don't do it unless you have a pattern in mind


Doesn't fit a pattern or doesn't work out from above?

mind hit a brick wall - need to try a different strategy
    do you have an OR as a claim? try OrE with it
    nothing is working? Try PbC. Assume ¬(what you want),
    try to get a F.





When to use BottomE? If you are using OrE and can't 
    get your goal in one subproof but can get F,
    use BottomE to conclude what you want.

    DON'T use in PbC or NegI if you get F, even though
        you *could*. Won't help finish the proof.

HW 4 problem 6

p → q   equivalent to   ¬p ∨ q


p → q  ⊢  ¬p ∨ q **
    Top-level operator of conclusion is an OR 
        Can I prove one side separately? Naaah
        As a backup, try PbC.
            Assume  ¬(¬p ∨ q)
                If we had ¬p ∨ q, we would have a F 
                    Try to prove just ¬p so can use OrI1
                    Use NegI subproof
                        Assume p

                        Goal F
                    conclude ¬p
            Goal: F

     



¬p ∨ q   ⊢  p → q
look at conclusion: top-level is →
ImplyI subproof
    Assume p 
        Try OrE subproofs with premise 
        Goal in both: q
    Goal: q



/////////////////////////

HW 4 problem 7

¬(p → q)    equivalent to   p ∧ ¬q


¬(p → q)  ⊢  p ∧ ¬q
Think about proving both sides separately - doesn't work well
As a last resort, try PbC on the conclusion
    Assume ¬(p ∧ ¬q)
        If we had p → q, would contradict with premise
        Try ImplyI subproof to get p → q
            Assume p 
                No obvious way to get q, try PbC
                Subproof, assume ¬q

                Goal: F

            Goal: q
    Goal: F




p ∧ ¬q   ⊢   ¬(p → q)
Break apart the premise
Use NegI subproof for conclusion
    Assume p → q

    goal F

A THEOREM in propositional logic is something that is
always true with no need for premises. For example:


Law of the excluded middle. (LEM)

p ∨ ¬p



What would a theorem be in a truth table?
tautology



Prove LEM (lem.sc):

⊢ ( p ∨ ¬p )               //lem.sc



⊢ (theorem that you are trying to prove)

/////////////////////////////////

SOUNDNESS and COMPLETENESS of natural deduction in
    propositional logic

    "provable": prove using natural deduction
    "true": demonstrate an argument with truth tables


SOUNDNESS: ?? everything I can prove is actually true

p ∧ q 
--------
p


COMPLETENESS: ?? I can prove everything that is true 

propositional logic deduction is both sound and completeness




--> what would it mean if a proof system was unsound?

bad

--> what would it mean if a proof system was incomplete?

there are true arguments we can't prove 




Propositional logic is both SOUND and COMPLETE.



Using natural deduction to prove the sequent:
    P1, P2, ..., Pn ⊢ q


Is equivalent to using truth tables to show that whenever
    P1, P2, ..., Pn
are true, then q is also true

Sets.

A set is an unordered collection of elements


{1,1,3,5,7} = {1,3,5,7} = {7,3,1,5}



∈: is in, exists in

    x ∈ A  means? element x exists in the set A

    x ∉ A  means? element x does not exist in set A



Example: A = {1,4,7,11,20}

    1 ∈ A 
    2 ∉ A



- Common sets in math:

    ℕ:  natural number (integers starting with 1)
    ℤ:  integers (postive, negative, 0 )
    ℚ: rational numbers. I can write the number as
        p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ and q != 0
    ℝ: real numbers 
    ℂ: complex numbers
    ∅: null set / empty set

ℕ ⊂ ℤ ⊂ ℚ ⊂ ℝ ⊂ ℂ

⊂ is subset of

Set builder notation.

: means, where, such that
| means the same thing

{x: x ∈ ℕ, 5 ≤ x ≤ 10}

{5,6,7,8,9,10}


{k : k is a letter in "abracadabra"}

{a, b, c, d, r}

{x : x = 2k,  k ∈ ℕ}

{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}

The union of the sets A and B, written A ⋃ B, is the set
of all elements....?

A ⋂ B =

B - A =


//////////////////

Subset - A is a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if
    all elements in A are also in B.

(We say A ⊂ B if A is a subset of B but A ≠ B.)




Example:

A = {1,3,4}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?



A = {8,1,3}

B = {1,3,5,8}

--> is A a subset of B?
