HW 1 - due Tuesday, January 27
    be sure to explain your reasoning when asked
    on logic puzzles, should be clear why your answer is the only  
        one

All ints.

if (x < 3 || y > 4) {
    statements1;
}
else if (x < 5 && y == 7) {
    statements2;
}
else {
    statements3;
}



--> is it possible for "statements2" to execute?

know that x < 3 || y > 4 is false 
    so x >= 3 && y <= 4
know that x < 5 && y == 7 is true 
    This conflicts with y <= 4

More with knights and knaves.

knights: each full statement that they make is true
knave: each full statement must be false




You meet three inhabitants: Sarah, Bill and Mae.

Sarah tells you that only a knave would say that Bill is a knave.
Bill claims that it's false that Mae is a knave.
Mae tells you, "Bill would tell you that I am a knave."

What types are Sarah, Bill, and Mae?

Sarah: Bill is a knight
Bill: Mae is a knight
Mae: Bill would say I'm a knave

Best place to start? Sarah
We suppose Sarah is a knight. Then Bill must be a knight, which would mean that Mae must be a knight.
This won't work since Bill would say that Mae is a knight. 

Suppose instead that Sarah is a knave. Then Bill and Mae must be knaves. Bill would lie and say Mae is a knight,
but Mae lies about this and says Bill would say knave. Works. 
Less confusing way to write the statements?



(How might we simplify everything?)


    


////////////////////////////////////

Lion always lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.
Lion always tells the truth on other days.
Unicorn always lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays,
    and always tells the truth on other days.

On Sunday, everyone tells the truth.

Lion says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days."
Unicorn says: "Yesterday was one of my lying days, too."

What day is it?

Sunday: Lion didn't lie yesterday, should be telling the truth. 
Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday/Saturday: whoever is lying that day
also lied the day before, and shouldn't be lying about that.
Monday: Unicorn tells the truth Mon/Sun, should say they didn't lie.
Thrusday: Lion truthfully says they lied on Wednesday, unicorn correctly 
lies about lying on Wednesday. 



////////////////////////////////

Tweedledee and Tweedledum are identical.
You know that one of them lies Mon/Tues/Wed,
and that the other lies Thurs/Fri/Sat.
(They tell the truth on non-lying days.)

(So they both tell the truth on Sunday.)

You don't know which is which.

You see both of them together.
The first one says: "I'm Tweedledum." 
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee."

Which is which? What day is it? Everyday they would give the same name
other than Sunday. They are who they say. 








//////////////////////////////////

In-class quiz





//////////////////////////////////

You know that either Tweedledum or Tweedledee has
    lost a rattle.
You find it, and want to return it to the correct one.
You don't know what day it is, but are sure that it isn’t
    Sunday.


(we know one is lying, one is telling truth)

The first one says: "Tweedledee owns the rattle."
The second one says: "I'm Tweedledee!"

Who gets the rattle?

Suppose the first twin is telling the true. Rattle goes to Tweedledee.
Second twin must by lying, so second twin is Tweedledum.
First twin is Tweedledee, so first twin gets the rattle.
 
Suppose instead that the first twin is lying. Tweedledum owns the rattle. Second twin is 
telling the truth, so they are Tweedledee. First twin is Tweedledum. The first twin (Tweedledum) 
gets the rattle. 

First twin gets the rattle.

Who is who?

This does not give us enough information to know who is who.

Based on Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".

There are three caskets – one gold, one silver,
    and one lead.
Exactly one of the caskets contains a portrait.
Each casket has a message on it, and you know that at most
    one of the messages is true.

Gold casket: "The portrait is in this casket."
Silver casket: "The portrait is not in this casket."
Lead casket: "The portrait is not in the gold casket."

Where is the portrait?

They could all be false, or just one message could be true. 
Suppose it's in the gold. Both Gold and Silver would be true, so not the case.
Suppose it's silver. Just one works so this works, or just one is true.
Suppose it's lead. This would not work as it has two trues.

Cheryl's birthday problem.

Written for Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad in 2015

Albert and Bernard want to know when Cheryl's birthday is.
Cheryl gives them 10 potential dates:

May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17

Cheryl privately tells Albert her birthday month.
    (May, June, July, or August)

Cheryl privately tells Bernard her birthday day (number).
    (14-19)


Albert says: "I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is,
    but I know Bernard doesn't know too."

Bernard says: "At first I didn't know when Cheryl's
    birthday is, but now I do."


Albert says: "Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is."


When is it? July 16




///////////////////////////////////

Start truth tables and logic gates.

    have boolean variables
    want to express statements like: p AND (q OR r)

Variables can be true or false

Basic operations:

∧   and (&&)
∨   or (inclusive or ||)
¬   not (!)
→   implies (if/then ->)


Basic logic gates (draw on board)
    AND, OR, NOT 


gates still used to design circuits


why do we care about equivalent circuits?
To saver space and money. 

what about programming?
Easier to know.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////

Fill in basic operations:


AND:

p q  #  p ∧ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    F
F T  #    F 
F F  #    F


OR:

p q  #  p ∨ q
--------------
T T  #    T
T F  #    T
F T  #    T
F F  #    F


NOT:

p  # ¬p
--------
T  # F
F  # T

////////////////////////////////////////////////

IMPLIES operator →

"If I have a test, then I will study"

p: I have a test
q: I will study

p → q

It is false if we have BROKEN A PROMISE.
Otherwise we have not.

p q  #  p → q
--------------
T T  #   T 
T F  #   F   
F T  #   T (vaculously true) 
F F  #   T (vaculously true)

/////////////////////////////////////////

How does the implies operator relate to programming?

Is is an if/then statement. 

//////////////////////////////////////////

Design circuits for:

¬(p ∨ q)       (p NOR q)

 p ──┐
     ├───( OR )───|>o─── Output
 q ──┘





p XOR q (with just the gates we've seen, not a specific XOR gate)

 p ──┐
     ├───( XOR )─── Output
 q ──┘



/////////////////////////////////////

How would we evaluate the output of these circuits with
different inputs?



Graphically build circuits:

https://logic.ly/demo/


//////////////////////////////////////

Evaluating logical statements.

Basic operations:

∧ - AND
∨ - OR (inclusive or)
¬ - NOT
→ - IMPLIES

////////////////////////////////////////

Consider ¬p ∨ q ∧ r.

--> what operation do we do first?





Order of operations

In math?





For logic statements:

From highest (happens first) to lowest (happens last) precedence:→ 
 (), ¬, ∧, ∨, → 

////////////////////////////////////////////////

Given this statement:

    (¬)p ∨ (q ∧ r)

Add () to show the order of operations.




Evaluate the above statement using these
variable assignments:

p is T
q is F
r is F
(F) v (F)
F

Next:
- more with order of operations
- bigger truth tables
- parse trees
- begin propositional logic
