How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1: two truth tables
    for every possible truth assignment, the two statements have same output

    Approach 2: 
    deduction with two proofs
    statement1 |- statement2
    statement2 |- statement1 




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

    find one truth assignment where the two statements have different output

    can't use deduction to prove not equivalent


What is satisfiability?

    to prove that a statement is satisfiable, only need one truth assignment where the statement outputs true
    (if we did a truth table, would be a tautology or contingent)

To show NOT satisfiable
    need full truth table to show the statement always outputs false
    (is contradictory)


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

    premises, conclusion
    valid: 
    if for every truth assignment where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
        1) truth table with all premises and conclusion
        look at truth assignments that make all premises true, make sure they make conclusion true

        2) Deduction

    how prove invalid?

    find one truth assignment where all premises are true but conclusion is false
    can't prove invalid with deduction


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
