HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

        p ∨ q ∨ r: top-level is the rightmost or
        //(p ∨ q) ∨ r

        Try OrE on premise
        SubProof: assume p ∨ q

            goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
            top-level is the rightmost Or
            could introduce OR if have r ∨ q
                or if I had p

            nested OrE
            SubProof: assume p 
                goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
                r ∨ q ∨ p by OrI2()

            SubProof: assume q 
                goal: r ∨ q ∨ p
                first get r ∨ q
                then get r ∨ q ∨ p

        SubProof: assume r

            goal: r ∨ q ∨ p


    How to build conclusion?





Exam 1 is Thursday, February 12
    Exam review session (by Erik and Drake):
        Wednesday, February 11, 2:30-5:00 pm in DUE 1118

No new homework this week

/////////////////////

Today:
- more involved natural deduction examples
- exam 1 review

/////////////////////

Reminder: implies-elimination, ImplyE

          P,P → Q
ImplyE: -----------
            Q



Implies symbol.

Typing a → in Logika for natural deduction:

    __>:

(two underscores, >, :)

//////////////////////////

Bigger examples: ex1.sc, ex2.sc, ex3.sc


/////////////////////////

Logika features/tips

- renumber/reformat proofs
- interpreting errors


/////////////////////////

General proof strategy to this point

1) list premises
2) break down any premises you can to get extra information

3) look at the conclusion

4) consider if you will need OrE (probably will if you have an OR)

Always consider order of operations!

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point 
(including today).


See Canvas announcement for list of topics.




How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1: two truth tables
    for every possible truth assignment, the two statements have same output

    Approach 2: 
    deduction with two proofs
    statement1 |- statement2
    statement2 |- statement1 




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

    find one truth assignment where the two statements have different output

    can't use deduction to prove not equivalent


What is satisfiability?

    to prove that a statement is satisfiable, only need one truth assignment where the statement outputs true
    (if we did a truth table, would be a tautology or contingent)

To show NOT satisfiable
    need full truth table to show the statement always outputs false
    (is contradictory)


- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

    premises, conclusion
    valid: 
    if for every truth assignment where all premises are true, the conclusion is also true

    how prove valid?
        1) truth table with all premises and conclusion
        look at truth assignments that make all premises true, make sure they make conclusion true

        2) Deduction

    how prove invalid?

    find one truth assignment where all premises are true but conclusion is false
    can't prove invalid with deduction


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended 
    (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
