HW 3 due tonight

    #5: p ∨ q ∨ r ⊢ r ∨ q ∨ p

    What will the structure be?

    what is the top level op? 
    p ∨ q ∨ r: top level is the rightmost or 
    (p ∨ q) ∨ r

    Try OrE on premise 
    SugbProof: assume p v q 

    goal: r v q v p 
    top-level is the rightmost Or 
    could introduce OR if have r v q 
        or if I had p 

        nested OrE
        SubProof: assume P 
        goal: r v q v p 

        SubProof: Assume q 
        goal: r v q v p 
        first get r v q 
        then get r v q v p

    How to build conclusion?

How to prove two propositional logic statements are 
equivalent?

    Approach 1:
    for every possible truth assignment, the two statements
    have the same output. 

    Approach 2:
    deduction with two proofs 
    statement1 | - statement2
    statement2 | = statement1




How to prove propositional logic statements are 
NOT equivalent?

find ONE where truth assignments have different outputs

cannot use deduction to prove not equivalent 





What is satisfiability? 

    need ONE truth assignment where the statement outputs true 
    ( if we did a truth table = tautology or contingent)

    To show NOT satisifiable?
     
     need FULL truth table to show the statement always outputs false 
     (i.e. is contradictory )



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    (what is an argument?)

    premises, conclusion 

    valid: 
        if for every truth assignment where all premises are true,
        the conclusion is also true 

    how prove valid?
    1) TRUTH TABLES with ALL of the premises + Conclusion 
        looking for truth assignments  that make all of it true !
        MAKE SURE THEY MAKE THE CONCLUSION true 

    2) deduction 


    how prove invalid?

        find ONE truth assignment where all premises true 
        but the conclusion is false, you cannot prove it is 
        invalid with deduction as some might think. 


/////////////////////////////////////////

Closed notes/computers.


Mix of multiple choice (like quizzes) and open-ended (like homework)

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation --
    read carefully!
